      "response": "Quantum computing is a new way of processing information that's different from the way regular computers work. Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n**Classical Computing**\n\nRegular computers use \"bits\" to store and process information. Bits can have only two values: 0 or 1. They're like light switches that can be either on (1) or off (0). This is called binary code.\n\n**Quantum Computing**\n\nQuantum computers use \"qubits\" (quantum bits) to store and process information. Qubits are special because they can exist in multiple states at the same time, not just 0 or 1. It's like a light switch that can be both on and off at the same time, or anywhere in between.\n\nImagine you have a coin that can be either heads or tails. A classical computer would say it's either one or the other, but a quantum computer can say it's both heads and tails at the same time!\n\n**How Qubits Work**\n\nQubits are like tiny particles that can exist in multiple states, which is called a \"superposition.\" This means that a qubit can process many possibilities simultaneously, whereas a classical computer would have to process each possibility one by one.\n\nWhen a qubit is measured, its state",
