Object Detection Algorithms:** This was Leona's primary focus. She developed several algorithms to automatically detect objects in images. These algorithms were groundbreaking and significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of image processing tasks.\n\n*   **Feature Extraction Algorithm (FEA):** This algorithm was designed to automatically identify the key features (edges, corners, loops, etc.) present in an image. It uses a combination of edge detection and shape analysis to create a robust feature map.\n*   **Edge-Based Segmentation Algorithm (EBSA):** This algorithm takes a raw image and segments it into different regions based on the edges detected by the FEA. It's used to isolate objects from the background and create a precise outline.\n*   **Depth Map Analysis Algorithm (DMA):** This algorithm analyzes the depth map of an image to determine the distance and relative position of objects within the scene. It's used to understand the spatial relationships between objects and their environment.\n\n**2.  Image Enhancement Algorithms:**  Leona also developed algorithms to enhance image quality, improving the visibility of objects.\n\n*   **Image Sharpening Algorithm (ISA):** This algorithm enhances the image sharpness by increasing the contrast and detail.\n*   **Color Correction Algorithm (CCA):** This algorithm adjusts the color balance of an image to optimize the appearance of objects.\n\n**3.  Image Transformation Algorithms:**  Leona created algorithms to manipulate images, such as rotating, scaling, and cropping.\n\n*   **Image Rotation Algorithm (IRA):** This algorithm rotates an image by a specified angle.\n*   **Image Scaling Algorithm (ISA):** This algorithm scales an image up or down.\n*   **Image Cropping Algorithm (ICA):** This algorithm crops an image to focus on a specific area.\n\n**4.  Image Blending Algorithms:**  Leona developed algorithms to combine multiple images together.\n\n*   **Image Blending Algorithm (IBA):** This algorithm combines multiple images to create a composite image.\n\n**Key Takeaways & Impact:**\n\n*   Leona Detiège's work revolutionized image processing, making it faster, more accurate, and more efficient.\n*   Her algorithms have applications in various fields, including:\n    *   ",
